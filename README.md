# About

This is a modified version of the script that adds ACC to unranked scores on [Score Saber](https://scoresaber.com) website. This version additionally fetches replay IDs from the BeatLeader API. The [original script](https://github.com/motzel/scoresaber-unranked-acc) was created by [motzel](https://github.com/motzel), and this modified version was created by hatopopvr.

## Installation

Get Tampermonkey for [Chrome/Edge Chromium](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo). Then install the script from [here](https://github.com/hatopopvr/scoresaber-enhanced-bl-replays/raw/master/scoresaber-enhanced-bl-replays.user.js).

**Note:** This modified version of the script has only been tested in Chrome. While it may work in other browsers, there may be unexpected issues.

## Known Issues

This script may encounter issues with CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) policy, preventing it from fetching data from the BeatLeader API. A possible workaround for this issue is to use a browser extension that allows CORS, such as [CORS Unblock for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cors-unblock/lfhmikememgdcahcdlaciloancbhjino).
